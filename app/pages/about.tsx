					<p>Hello, I'm &Eacute;pris Harris-Burnett</p>
					<p className="intro">I'm web developer and graphic designer in Charlotte, NC.</p>
					<p>I fell in love with technology at a young age. Around the age of eight I discovered I was a natural at drawing. During the MySpace years, I decided to merge the two talents together by customizing pages for friends. Ultimately, graphic design was the path I walked before finding my way back into developing. Now, I'm enjoying the best of both worlds; where creativity and logic coincide.</p>
